        "You will work with a real industrial hydraulic test rig dataset from the UCI Machine\n",
        "Learning Repository. The system repeats 60-second load cycles and records multi-sensor\n",
        "time series (pressures, flows, temperatures, motor power, vibration, and efficiency\n",
        "metrics) while four key components degrade: cooler, valve, pump, and accumulator.\n",

        "# 2. Dataset\n",
        "• 2205 cycles (rows); each row = 1 load cycle (~60 seconds)\n",
        "• 43680 attributes (columns) – unfolded multi-rate time series per cycle\n",
        "• Sensors: PS1–PS6 (pressure), EPS1 (motor power), FS1–FS2 (flows), TS1–TS4\n",
        "(temperatures), VS1 (vibration), CE/CP/SE (performance indices)\n",
        "• Targets (from profile.txt):\n",
        "- Cooler condition (%): {3, 20, 100}\n",
        "- Valve condition (%): {100, 90, 80, 73}\n",
        "- Pump leakage: {0, 1, 2}\n",
        "- Accumulator pressure (bar): {130, 115, 100, 90}\n",
        "- Stable flag: {0, 1}\n",
        "3. Core Tasks\n",
        "A. EDA\n",
        "• Load data; inspect shapes and target distributions.\n",
        "• Plot sample cycles for key sensors (e.g., PS1, TS1, VS1).\n",
        "• Compare healthy vs faulty states for one target (e.g., pump leakage).\n",
        "B. Feature Engineering (cycle-level)\n",
        "For a subset of sensors (e.g., 2 pressures, 1 flow, 1 temperature, vibration):\n",
        "• Compute mean, std, min, max, percentiles, and simple trend features per cycle.\n",
        "• Optionally add domain features (pressure range, temperature gradient, RMS vibration).\n",
        "C. Single-Target Classification\n",
        "Pick one target (recommended: pump leakage or cooler condition).\n",
        "• Train at least 2 models (e.g., Logistic Regression / Decision Tree vs Random\n",
        "Forest/XGBoost).\n",
        "• Evaluate with accuracy, macro F1, and a confusion matrix.\n",
        "D. Interpretation & Business Insight\n",
        "• Show feature importance (e.g., Random Forest or permutation importance).\n",
        "• Explain: Which sensors and patterns indicate degradation? How do vibration/temperature\n",
        "change as failure worsens?\n",
        "• Write 1–2 paragraphs in plain language for a maintenance engineer.\n",
        "4. Stretch Tasks (Optional)\n",
        "• Multi-target models (predict multiple component states).\n",
        "• Anomaly detection / health index using autoencoders or Isolation Forest.\n",
        "• Simple dashboard (Gradio/Streamlit) to input features and get a risk prediction.\n",
        "5. Deliverables\n",
        "• Jupyter/Colab notebook with clear sections (Intro, EDA, Features, Models, Insights).\n",
        "• Short report or 3–5 slide deck summarizing approach, performance, and recommendations."
